SDs
==========================================
The Python script here will scan a given directory for SD files.
Using the given .ags (ArcGIS Server connection file), it will publish those SDs.

Note: You will need to update or create a new .ags connection file. You will also have to update the paths inside the script.
This script will only run on a machine with ArcGIS installed due to the arcpy dependencies.
